\section{Observations}

We propose LFSR algorithm based on three major observations:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {\bf Observation 1:} Local feature in the salient region are close to each other, while noisy and unimportant features are far away from them. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:observation_1}, local features in the salient region (green box) gather together and many obvious unimportant local features locate far from that box.

	\item {\bf Observation 2:} The region with most local features is the preferred salient region. Also from Figure \ref{fig:observation_1}, the preferred salient region in the green box has much more local feature than other two yellow boxes.

	\item {\bf Observation 3:} There may exist several salient regions in one image. For example, the photo in Figure \ref{fig:observation_2} contains two .....

\end{itemize}

Observation 1 indicates a method to rewrite our a
