In this paper, we have presented a Local Feature based Salient Region algorithm. With computing directly on local image features, LFSR becomes a straightforward and lightweight approach to detect approximate salient regions. According to our evaluation, LFSR can help to improve the performance of SURF descriptor with a 1.6X speedup. Furthermore, when using LFSR in a realistic image retrieval system, both the accuracy and the query performance are improved.
