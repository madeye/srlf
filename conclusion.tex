\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present a Salient Region conducted Local Feature algorithm. With computing directly on local image features, {\sys} takes advantage of an approximate salient regions approach to perform local feature reduction. According to our evaluation, {\sys} can help to improve the performance of SURF descriptor with a 1.6X speedup. Furthermore, when used in a realistic image retrieval system, our algorithm improve the query performance more than 2 times.
