Local feature algorithms, as the most important part of image and video retrieval systems, involve thousands of high-dimension feature vectors to represent one image or one video frame, which leads to a great pressure for real-time processing and large-scale data storage. After a comprehensive analysis on the relation between the salient region and the geometric distribution of local features, we present a Salient Region conducted Local Feature algorithm~({\sys}) that is based on existing local feature algorithms and employs salient regions to conduct the local feature reduction. We also introduce an approximate salient region detection approach which is much faster than state-of-the-art salient region algorithms and shows less precision loss when integrated to a realistic image retrieval system. When compared to the original local feature algorithms, {\sys} achieves an overall 1.6X speedup with more than 50\% local features reduced.
