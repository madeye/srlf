Local feature descriptors have become the most important part in image / video retrieval systems. But considering the great amount of local features, thousands of local features in one HD photo, it's hard to compute them efficiently in a realistic system. In our research, we overcome this obstacle with a straightforward local feature reduction processing by using a algorithm named LFSR (Local Feature based Salient Region). With no additional computation for salient regions, this algorithm help to improve both the performance and accuracy of local feature descriptors. In our evaluation, we also compare LFSR algorithm with a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm. And the results shows that LFSR provides a thousands of times computation speedup, with an acceptable precision loss. Furthermore, when integrated with the SURF algorithm, LFSR can provide a overall 1.6X speedup for the whole processing \cite{Cooper}.
