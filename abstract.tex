{\lfea}s, as the most important part of image and video retrieval systems, generally involve thousands of high-dimension feature vectors to represent an image or a video frame. Although such a design can guarantee retrieval accuracy, it leads to a great pressure on real-time processing and large-scale data storage. After a comprehensive analysis on the relation between the salient region and local features, we find the distribution of local features in salient regions is denser compared to that outside the regions. Based on this observation, we propose an approximate salient region detection approach, which is much faster than state-of-the-art salient region algorithms and shows less precision loss when integrated to a realistic image retrieval system. Furthermore, we  also design and implement a Salient Region conducted Local Feature algorithm~({\sys}) through employing salient regions to conduct the local feature reduction. When compared to the original local feature algorithms, {\sys} achieves an overall 1.6X speedup with about 58\% storage reduction and 7\% accuracy loss.
