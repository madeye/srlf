Local feature descriptors have become the most important part in image / video retrieval systems. But considering the great amount of local features, the computation could be not efficient enough for a realistic system. For example, thousands of local features in a VGA image means a processing speed far from the requirement of real time applications.~\cite{Fang2011ispass}

To overcome this obstacle, we purpose a approximate but very efficient local feature reduction approach called LFSR (Local Feature based Salient Region). Combined with local features compactly and without introducing additional image feature computing, this approach helps to improve both the performance of local feature descriptors and the whole retrieval system. In our evaluation, we compare LFSR algorithm with a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm~\cite{achanta2009frequency}. The result shows that LFSR provides a thousands of times computation speedup with an acceptable precision loss. Furthermore, when integrated with a local feature descriptor, LFSR can provide an overall 1.6X speedup with more than 50\% local features removed.
