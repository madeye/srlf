Local feature descriptors have become the most important part in image / video retrieval systems. But considering the great amount of local features, for example, thousands of local features in one HD photo, the computation is not efficient in a realistic system. 

To overcome this obstacle, we purpose a straightforward local feature reduction approach by using the LFSR (Local Feature based Salient Region) algorithm. With a lightweight salient region detection, this algorithm help to improve both the performance of local feature descriptors. In our evaluation, we also compare LFSR algorithm with a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm~\cite{achanta2009frequency}. The results shows that LFSR provides a thousands of times computation speedup, with an acceptable precision loss. Furthermore, when integrated with the SURF descriptor, LFSR can provide an overall 1.6X speedup.
