Local feature algorithms, as the most important part in image and video retrieval systems, involve thousands of feature points to represent an image or a video frame, which leads to a great pressure for real-time processing and large-scale data storage. After a comprehensive analysis on the relation between the salient region and the distribution of feature points in images, we present a Salient Region conducted Local Feature algorithm~({\sys}) to reduce the great amount of local features. With many features outside the salient region dropped, the efficiency of the whole image retrieval system will also be improved. Experimental results show that the approximate salient region used in {\sys} outperform a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm by an order of magnitude in computation efficiency. When compared to the original local feature algorithms, {\sys} achieves an overall 1.6X speedup with more than 50\% local features filtered out.
