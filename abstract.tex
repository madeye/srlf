Local feature descriptors have become the most important part in image / video retrieval systems. But considering the great amount of local features, for example, thousands of local features in one HD photo, the computation could be not efficient enough for a realistic system. 

To overcome this obstacle, we purpose a local feature reduction approach called LFSR (Local Feature based Salient Region). With a straightforward and approximate salient region detection, this approach helps to improve both the performance of local feature descriptors and the whole retrieval system. In our evaluation, we compare LFSR algorithm with a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm~\cite{achanta2009frequency}. The result shows that LFSR provides a thousands of times computation speedup with an acceptable precision loss. Furthermore, when integrated with a local feature descriptor, LFSR can provide an overall 1.6X speedup.
