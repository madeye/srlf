Local feature descriptors have become one of the most important parts in image or video retrieval systems. To achieve high retrieval accuracy, they generally include some complex transformation computation and select hundred of feature points to represent an image or a video frame, which make it put a great pressure on real-time processing and large-scale data storage. 

To overcome these obstacles, we make a comprehensive analysis on the relation between the salient region and the distribution of feature points  in images. We observe that a salient region has more dense local features compared to other regions. Based on the observation, we design and implement a local feature-based salient region detection algorithms~({\sys}). After the local features are detected, the regions with the most dense feature points are chosen as the salient regions. And only the feature points in these regions will be described as the final feature points.  Experimental results show that {\sys} provides a thousands of times computation speedup with a similar accuracy compared to a state-of-art salient region algorithm. It achieves a processing speed of about 0.003s per image. Furthermore, when integrated with a local feature descriptor, {\sys} can achieve an overall 1.6X speedup with more than 50\% local features reduction.
