There exists many kinds of local feature descriptors. SIFT~\cite{lowe1999object}\cite{lowe2004distinctive} is the most publicly accepted and robust local feature-based image extraction algorithm. For different conditions or purposes, some variants of SIFT are also widely used, such as RIFT~\cite{lazebnik2005sparse}, GLOH~\cite{mikolajczyk2005performance}, and PCA-SIFT~\cite{ke2004pca}. To deal with the performance issue of SIFT, SURF~\cite{Bay2006SURF} is proposed in 2006 as a optimized local feature descriptor based on SIFT. With acceptable precision loss, SURF tends to be an efficient alternative of SIFT. Most of these algorithms are insensitive to various transformations, such as scaling, rotation and illumination.

Most salient region researches focus on generating precise salient map, and some of them~\cite{cheng2011global,achanta2009frequency} have already achieved impressive precision and recall. Since salient region is really helpful to local feature descriptors, researchers had tried to just combine them together. Huang et al.~\cite{huang2009image} try to
