\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section, we first present some precision comparisons for LFSR. To show the performance improvement of local feature descriptor with LFSR, an evaluation is also performed on a LFSR enabled SURF descriptor.

\subsection{Experimental Comparison}
\label{sec:evaluation_comparison}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we target to design a algorithm for local feature reduction, and salient region detection is just suitable for that task. To achieve a good performance, we present LFSR instead of directly using any existed salient region algorithm. Although LFSR is only a approximate algorithm, we are still interested in evaluating its precision against others. Here we compare LFSR with a previous research named FTSR (Frequency-Tuned Salient Region) by Achanta et al.~\ref{achanta2009frequency}. FTSR is a state-of-the-art salient region algorithm with a C++ implementation which is easy to compare the performance.

Since we only focus on local features, our evaluation differs from other salient region researches: the precision and recall are given according to the results of local feature reduction, not the precise salient region boundary. The evaluated dataset is also provided by Achanta et at.~\ref{achanta2009frequency}, which is a subset of the public database by Liu et at.~\ref{liu2011learning}.
