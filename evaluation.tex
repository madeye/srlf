\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section, we first present some precision comparisons for LFSR. To show the performance improvement of local feature descriptor with LFSR, an evaluation is also performed on a LFSR enabled SURF descriptor.

\subsection{Experimental Comparison}
\label{sec:evaluation_comparison}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we target to design a algorithm for local feature reduction, and salient region detection is just suitable for that task. To achieve a good performance, we present LFSR instead of directly using any existed salient region algorithm. Although LFSR is only a approximate algorithm, we are still interested in evaluating its precision against others.
